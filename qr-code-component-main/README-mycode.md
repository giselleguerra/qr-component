## My process

First I built the HTML structure.
Added a link to the style CSS page.
Changed the last <div> for <footer>.
Then I did all the stylization of the page by using only the CSS propreties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project I was able to recap some things about html and css.
I've learned to add a shadow-box to a area, and use the rgb kind of color.

### Continued development

Keep on studying and practicing html and css. And then increase the study adding some Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](getcssscan.com) - This helped me for add box-shadow. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
